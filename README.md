## Motivation
I wanted the portfolio to be fun, fresh and minimalistic. I kept the colour palette clean and picked the two projects I was most proud of to display. 

## Criteria
Updated portfolio featuring at least 3 examples of student work from either deployed projects of homeworks<br>
Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring at least 3 examples of student work from either deployed projects of homeworks<br>
Updated resume<br>
Updated LinkedIn profile<br>



## Process
I started using an old template and updating it to make it more responsive. I wanted the header to have all the key, quick-access information. 
<br>
I selected my favourite projects and wrote short "abouts" with accompaying images.
